# wk1codechallenge
Code challenge 1:
  1. The algorithm first prompts the user for input
  2. The marks input are then passed through the function gradeMarks() which       returns a grade based on the range the marks lie.
  3. The algorithm then returns the marks input and the grade assigned

Code challenge 2:
  1. The algorithm first prompts the user for input
  2. The speed input is then passed through the function speedDetector() which checks for the speed value and returns a judgement. The speed limit is 70km/s. if the speed value is greater than the limit, for every 5 units it exceeds the limit by, a demerit point is issued. The total demerit points exceed 12, the drivers license is suspended.
  3. The algoritm then returns the speed input, demerit points(if any) and the judgement

Code challenge 3;
  1. The algorithm first prompts the user for input(basic salary and benefits)
  2. The two values input are passed through different functions to acquire the values: gross salary, tax on the salary, NHIF & NSSF deductions on the salary and Net salary per month
  3. The algorithm then returns the gross salary, the tax, the deductions and the net pay.
